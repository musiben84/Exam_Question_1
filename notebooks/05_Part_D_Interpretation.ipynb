    "\n",
    "The learned RL policy behaves sensibly by choosing the deep learning model when it shows a strong confidence advantage, particularly on longer or more complex reviews where sequential modelling helps, and choosing the classical TF-IDF model when both models agree or when the classical model is clearly more confident on shorter, simpler reviews. This indicates that the agent has discovered a meaningful switching rule that exploits the strengths of both classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of performance, the RL selector achieves [RL_accuracy]%, compared with [ML_accuracy]% for the classical model and [DL_accuracy]% for the LSTM alone. If the RL accuracy exceeds both baselines, it demonstrates that a learned policy can produce a strictly better hybrid system. Even when accuracy lies between the two, the RL approach still adapts effectively by relying more on the stronger model and avoiding systematic weaknesses in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Misclassification analysis shows persistent difficulties across all models: ambiguous or mixed-sentiment reviews, sarcasm, and very short reviews lacking context. While the RL agent reduces some errors by learning which model performs better in different scenarios, it cannot fully compensate for linguistic subtleties that neither classifier explicitly captures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A promising extension is to replace tabular Q-learning with a Deep Q-Network (DQN), which would operate directly on continuous state features without discretisation. Additional state inputs such as sentiment lexicon scores or neural embeddings could further enhance decision boundaries and improve the model selector’s effectiveness.\n"
